  Hi next person or parent updating the PS41 chess webpage. Well, it's on Wordpress, 
  I needed to switch templates in 2024 when PHP 7.4 went defunct and the wordpress.com server was updating everything to PHP 8.1
  The template designed after 10/15 years ago isn't compatible, I tried updating it, but it was a no go. 
  I decided to use a default wordpress template: twenty twenty, and create a child theme for it, in order for updates to be able to be applied for the longest time.
  I thought everything would be Node and Javascript in the web, but here it is, this will seem so "legacy" when you read it.
  I made a github repo so you can grab all this code, since it is inacessable even if you ssh into the sever.

  All the best and watch out for the 4 move checkmate,
  Nick
